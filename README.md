# Predicting-High-Tumour-Mutational-Burden-in-Cancer-Patients
The clinical trials team requires a predictive model to identify cancer patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB), a biomarker strongly associated with positive responses to immunotherapy. Currently, there is no direct and efficient method to measure TMB, making it challenging for patients to access appropriate testing.
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that analyzes patient demographics, laboratory results, vital signs, and biomarkers to predict high TMB status. By doing so, it enables faster and more personalized treatment recommendations, helping clinicians select patients who are most likely to benefit from immunotherapy. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, evaluation, and a discussion of potential clinical and business impacts.

# Predicting-High-TMB-in-Cancer-patients
We are developing a machine learning model to predict high tumor mutational burden (TMB) using patient data. This will help identify cancer patients who are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy.
